## scampi_factor_graph_optimization
This file contain the Cpp code for solver in ceres optimizer. 
This can be useful for:
- Test and verification of python model and maple model
- To check th optimization results in different initial robot pos compare to other optimizer
### Run
Running this code just needed to modify your initial pose in `main.c` and compile it.
