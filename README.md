## Kinematics-Inertial Fusion for Localization of an Underactuated Suspended Robot Considering Cable Sag
This repository holds the Ceres implementation of the kinematic solver considering cable sag
## Requirement
Install the [Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) library

Install also Ceres as described in this [ceres_solver](http://ceres-solver.org/installation.html) 

Then install [gtsam](https://github.com/borglab/gtsam)

Install [symforce](https://github.com/symforce-org/symforce)

Install Manif (Lie Theory tools):

```
git clone https://github.com/artivis/manif.git
cd manif && mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
sudo make install
```

## Python interface of solver
comming soon ...
