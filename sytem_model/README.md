## scampi_factor_graph_optimization
System model is generated here from two ways:
- Maple 
- python
### Run python model
Verification for python code is done using cpp-test folder. This python model is using for generating all the cost functions and jacobians which used in factor graph. Running this script will generate all these header files using Symforce with handeled name in `scampi_factor_graph/cpp` directory.
